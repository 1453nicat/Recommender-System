# Recommender-System
Recommender Rystem using GroupLens Movies Dataset

# Description

First of all, a recommender system is a type of software or algorithm designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences or behaviors. It is widely used in e-commerce, entertainment, and content platforms to enhance user experience and engagement. Additionally, this project leverages the GroupLens Movies Dataset (MovieLens) to build and evaluate a recommender system. Recommender systems are a cornerstone of modern e-commerce and entertainment platforms, helping users discover content tailored to their preferences. The goal of this project is to use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to recommend movies to users effectively.
